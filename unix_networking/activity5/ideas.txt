Objective : 
The objective of this lab is to : 
    Practice querying and analyzing user and system-wide crontab configurations in a Linux environment.
    Inspect scheduled tasks for different users, differentiate between active and commented entries, and identify jobs based on specific time schedules.
    This will strengthen your skills in system auditing, automation troubleshooting, and command-line text processing.

Quiz : 
    You are supposed to attempt the quiz on crontabs
    Use the container terminal to inspect the cronjobs and based on that answer the questions in the quiz 

Important : 
    Use `sudo crontab -l -u <username>` to inspect other user's cron entries.
    When counting, ignore blank lines and comments (lines starting with `#`).
    System-wide jobs in `/etc/crontab` or `/etc/cron.d/` also count toward roots total.
    Do not create or delete any crontab entries; this lab is read-only.

Tips for Success :
    Search system files (`/etc/crontab`, `/etc/cron.d/`) for time patterns.
