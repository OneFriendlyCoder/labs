Background Details : 

You are a network administrator at a tech company. The operations team reports that employees are experiencing slow internet speeds and are unable to access certain websites. Before diving into deeper troubleshooting, you decide to verify basic network connectivity from your own machine. Checking local connectivity is often the first diagnostic step to determine if the issue is on the local host or further along the network path.  

The `ping` command is one of the most widely used network troubleshooting tools. It works by sending ICMP Echo Request packets to a specified host and measuring the time it takes for the host to reply with ICMP Echo Reply packets.  

Objective : 
To use the `ping` command to test connectivity to the localhost, understand its key options, and document both the command used and answers to specific questions about its flags.  

Task : 
Run the `ping` command to localhost exactly 5 times and explicitly set the interval between packets to 2 seconds.
Save the command used into the file `solutions.txt`.  

Submission : 
In `submissions.txt.txt`, replace `<command>` with the exact command you ran.  
    
Important : 
Use `ping` in standard Linux shell syntax.  
The `localhost` address can be specified as either `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.  
Ensure your command runs successfully before recording it in `solutions.txt`.  
Be precise when writing flag names and answers incorrect formatting will be marked wrong.
