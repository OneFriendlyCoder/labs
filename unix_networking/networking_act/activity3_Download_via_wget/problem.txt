Objective : 
Download the file `system_update` from `http://localhost:30001/system_update` using `wget`.  
Save the file into a directory named `downloads` in the current working directory.  
Record the exact `wget` command you used in `/home/labDirectory/solutions.txt`.  

Task : 
1. Ensure the lab server is running at `http://localhost:30001` (the server will be available during the lab).  
2. Create a `downloads` directory in the current working directory if it does not already exist (e.g., `mkdir p downloads`).  
3. Use `wget` to download `http://localhost:30001/system_update` and place it inside `downloads/`.  

Submission
Edit `/home/labDirectory/solutions.txt`: replace `<command>` with the exact `wget` command you executed.  
Do not alter any other text or formatting in the file.  
Ensure the downloaded file exists at `./downloads/system_update` before finishing â€” the presence and content of this file will be validated.

Quiz :
There is a quiz based on the wget and ip commands. 
You are required to use the commands in the activity terminal and answer the questions based on the output of the commands.
