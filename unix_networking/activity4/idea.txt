Objective : 
By the end of this lab you will be able to:
Distinguish between `dpkg` and `apt` and know when to use each tool.
Install a local `.deb` package with `dpkg -i` and resolve any missing dependencies.
Use `apt` to refresh package lists and install packages non interactively.
Verify installed packages by capturing version output to files for automated grading.
Troubleshoot common dependency errors using `apt -f install` (or `apt-get install -f`).
Follow lab constraints (non-interactive mode, correct file paths, and avoiding `sudo` for the provided commands).


Tasks : 
**Install `htop`** from the pre-downloaded `.deb` in `/home/labDirectory/` using `dpkg`, ensuring all dependencies are satisfied.
**Install `vim`** using `apt`, refreshing package lists first if necessary.
Verify installations by running `htop --version` and `vim --version`, and redirecting their output to `htop.txt` and `vim.txt` respectively in the current directory.


Submission Template : 
Write the commands in the submission.txt file present in the /home/labDirectory/
Autograder will check if "htop" and "vim" are installed or not.

**Important:**

Dependency errors: If `dpkg -i` reports missing dependencies, run `apt-get install -f` (or `apt -f install`) to fix them.
Non interactive mode: Ensure commands run without prompts (use `-y` with `apt` if needed).
Permissions: Do not use `sudo` for installation commands.
File paths: Reference `/home/labDirectory/htop_*.deb` explicitly do not move the file.


**Good luck and enjoy mastering Debian package tools!**
