Objective

The objective of this assignment is to help students practice modern CSS layout techniques by completing the missing style rules inside the `.hero-inner`, `.site-header`, and `.filters` selectors.  

By solving these TODOs, students will learn how to:

1. Work with fixed and liquid containers
- Use `max-width` with a custom CSS variable (`--site-width`).  
- Center containers horizontally with `margin: 0 auto`.  
- Apply horizontal padding for balanced spacing.  

2. Build responsive layouts using Flexbox
- Apply `display: flex` for layout structuring.  
- Align content vertically with `align-items: center`.  
- Distribute space across elements using `justify-content: space-between`.  
- Use `gap` to create consistent spacing between items.  
- Practice `flex-wrap` to allow items to wrap naturally on smaller screens.  

3. Style utility sections (Hero, Header, Filters)
- Hero section: Understand how to structure a liquid hero with centered inner content.  
- Site header: Apply flexbox to position the brand logo and navigation menu side by side.  
- Filters bar: Learn how to make a filter toolbar that adapts responsively with wrapping behavior.  

4. Responsive design thinking
- Recognize how fixed layouts (`--site-width`) and fluid layouts (`100%` width) can be combined.  
- Understand how Flexbox properties change the behavior of layouts at different screen sizes.

Task Details

In the provided `styles.css` file, locate the commented TODO sections inside these selectors:

 `.hero-inner`
 `.site-header`
 `.filters`  

Each TODO comment describes exactly what you need to implement (e.g., set width, background color, border thickness, alignment).  

Replace the placeholder `content: '';` inside each block with valid CSS declarations that match the instructions.

---

Rules

1. Only edit the declaration blocks with TODO comments.  
2. Do not change, rename, or delete selectors.  
3. Use the exact property values stated in the requirements (colors, units, padding, etc.).  
4. Do not remove the TODO comments â€” they guide you and are part of the assignment.  
5. Be precise: incorrect values or syntax errors will cause grading tests to fail.

Submission Format

You must submit:

 A single CSS file: `css/styles.css`
 This file should contain all required changes within the given declaration blocks.
 No extra files, comments, or code changes outside the allowed areas.
