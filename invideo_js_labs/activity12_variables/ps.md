# Variables and Data Types

## Problem Statement

You need to implement a JavaScript program that demonstrates your understanding of basic variables and data types. The program should:

1. Create a string variable for a name
2. Create a number variable for an age
3. Create a boolean variable for student status

The program should display each variable's value in an HTML element with the ID 'output'.

## Required Operations

Your program should:
1. Create a variable named 'name' and set it to "John"
2. Create a variable named 'age' and set it to 20
3. Create a variable named 'isStudent' and set it to true

Do not remove the existing HTML elements or change their IDs or edit the existing JavaScript code. You can add new JavaScript code as needed.
