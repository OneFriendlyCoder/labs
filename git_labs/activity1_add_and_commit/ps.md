Please go through the README in labDirectory folder before attempting this activity. It describes how to setup the directory and submit your work.


Navigate to the scripts/ directory and run :- bash reset.sh.


***PLEASE USE RESET.SH CAREFULLY, IT CAN RESET YOUR WHOLE WORK WITH NO WAY OF RECOVERING IF IT HASNT BEEN COMMITTED***


Now, in the folder working_directory, you have been given 3 files README.txt, add.h, and main.cpp. These files when compiled, generate an executable that takes in 2 integers as input and prints their sum on the screen.


All the git commands have to be run inside the working_directory folder (otherwise it may interfere with the parent git folder leading to issues while submitting).


1. Initialize a new empty git repository inside the working_directory folder.

2. For the first commit, add only the README file, with the commit message Added README.txt.

3. For the next commit, add the add.h file (in addition to the README.txt already committed), with the commit message Added add.h

4. For the next commit, add only the main.cpp file (in addition to the README.txt and add.h already committed), with the commit message Added main.cpp


To create the solution tar file, navigate to the scripts/ directory and run:- bash submit.sh


Remember to use the given scripts given before submitting, or if you wish to reset the entire directory and start afresh.

More details on script usage can be found in the README in the labDirectory.
