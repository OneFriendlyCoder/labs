## **Problem Statement: Fixed vs. Liquid Layout Styling Challenge**

### **Objective**

Your task is to complete a **CSS layout exercise** by applying styling rules to demonstrate the difference between:

1. **Fixed-width layout**  
2. **Liquid (fluid) layout**  

You are provided with a partially completed `styles.css` file. Certain declaration blocks contain **TODO comments** where you must insert the correct CSS properties. Your role is to edit **only these blocks** to meet the specified requirements.

The goal is to help you understand:

- How fixed-width layouts behave across different screen sizes.  
- How liquid layouts adapt fluidly with the viewport.  
- The correct usage of **widths, max-widths, padding, backgrounds, borders, and text alignment**.  
- Maintaining clean, valid CSS syntax with precise values.

### **Task Details**

In the provided `styles.css` file, locate the **commented TODO sections** inside these selectors:

* `.fixed-demo .container`  
* `.fixed-demo .fixed-header`  
* `.fixed-demo .fixed-footer`  
* `.liquid-demo .container`  
* `.liquid-demo .liquid-header`  
* `.liquid-demo .liquid-footer`  

Each TODO comment describes exactly what you need to implement (e.g., set width, background color, border thickness, alignment).  

Replace the placeholder `content: '';` inside each block with **valid CSS declarations** that match the instructions.

### **Rules**

1. **Only edit the declaration blocks with TODO comments.**  
2. Do not change, rename, or delete selectors.  
3. Use the **exact property values** stated in the requirements (colors, units, padding, etc.).  
4. Do not remove the TODO comments â€” they guide you and are part of the assignment.  
5. Be precise: incorrect values or syntax errors will cause grading tests to fail.
