Objective
Your task is to complete a CSS layout exercise by applying styling rules to demonstrate the difference between:

1. Fixed-width layout  
2. Liquid (fluid) layout  

You are provided with a partially completed `styles.css` file. Certain declaration blocks contain TODO comments where you must insert the correct CSS properties. Your role is to edit only these blocks to meet the specified requirements.
The goal is to help you understand:
- How fixed-width layouts behave across different screen sizes.  
- How liquid layouts adapt fluidly with the viewport.  
- The correct usage of widths, max-widths, padding, backgrounds, borders, and text alignment.  
- Maintaining clean, valid CSS syntax with precise values.  

Task : 
In the provided `styles.css` file, locate the commented TODO sections inside these selectors:

 `.fixed-demo .container`  
 `.fixed-demo .fixed-header`  
 `.fixed-demo .fixed-footer`  
 `.liquid-demo .container`  
 `.liquid-demo .liquid-header`  
 `.liquid-demo .liquid-footer`  

Each TODO comment describes exactly what you need to implement (e.g., set width, background color, border thickness, alignment).  
Replace the placeholder `content: '';` inside each block with valid CSS declarations that match the instructions.

Rules :
1. Only edit the declaration blocks with TODO comments.  
2. Do not change, rename, or delete selectors.  
3. Use the exact property values stated in the requirements (colors, units, padding, etc.).  
4. Do not remove the TODO comments â€” they guide you and are part of the assignment.  
5. Be precise: incorrect values or syntax errors will cause grading tests to fail.  

Submission Format :
A single CSS file: `css/styles.css`
This file should contain all required changes within the given declaration blocks.
No extra files, comments, or code changes outside the allowed areas.
The autograder will check for the exact CSS properties and their values as specified in the TODO blocks. Make sure to write the property values exactly as given.

The expected output would look like :
