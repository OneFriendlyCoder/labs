 Objective

Your task is to complete a Flexbox-based layout exercise by applying CSS styles to three different sections:

1. Section 1 – Horizontal wrapping layout with mixed flexible and fixed boxes.  
2. Section 2 – Vertical wrapping layout simulating columns of variable content height.  
3. Section 3 – Reversed horizontal layout with proportional item growth/shrinkage.  

You are given a partially completed `styles.css` file. Each section has commented TODO blocks where you must insert your CSS rules. Your role is to only modify these specified blocks, following the instructions provided inside the comments.

The goal is to help you understand:

- How to control flex direction, wrapping, and alignment.  
- How to use flex shorthand (`flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, `flex-basis`) effectively.  
- How different flexbox properties affect box sizing and distribution.  
- How to style flex containers differently across sections (backgrounds, borders, spacing).  


 Task Details

In the provided `styles.css` file, locate the commented TODO sections within each selector’s declaration block for:

 `.s1 .flexbox`
 `.s1 .box:nth-child(odd)`
 `.s1 .box:nth-child(even)`
 `.s2 .flexbox`
 `.s2 .box`
 `.s3 .flexbox`

Each block includes a list of instructions describing what you need to implement (e.g., layout direction, wrapping, spacing, growth/shrink, padding, background colors, and borders).  

You must replace the placeholder `content: '';` with valid CSS rules that satisfy the given requirements.



 Rules

1. Only edit the declaration blocks with TODO comments. Do not modify other CSS selectors or properties.  
2. Do not delete or rename selectors — graders will look for the exact selector names.  
3. Follow the instructions carefully (e.g., background color choice, min-height, spacing).  
4. Use correct CSS syntax (`property: value;`). Small typos in values or units will break evaluation.  
5. Do not remove the comments — they are part of the exercise scaffold.  

 Submission Format

You must submit:

 A single CSS file: `css/styles.css`
 This file should contain all required changes within the given declaration blocks.
 No extra files, comments, or code changes outside the allowed areas.
