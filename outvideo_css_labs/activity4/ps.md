Objective  
Your task is to apply CSS styling to complete the design of a responsive webpage layout. The layout includes a site header, a hero section, and content grid areas (main article + sidebar).  
You will be provided with a partially completed CSS file (styles.css) containing empty declaration blocks for specific elements. Your job is to fill in these declaration blocks only where instructed, using the correct property values for flexbox, grid alignment, responsive typography, and image scaling.  
The goal is to help you understand :  
How to use flexbox for header alignment and navigation layout.  
How to create fluid typography with viewport-based units.  
How to make responsive images that adapt to different screen sizes.  
How to apply max-width and scaling rules to avoid distortion.  

Task Details : 
In the provided styles.css file, locate the commented TODO sections within each selector’s declaration block for:  

.header-inner  
.hero-title  
.hero-img  
.responsive-img, .hero-img, .full-width-img  
.maxwidth-img  

Each TODO contains :  
Instructions for what properties to add (e.g., display: flex;, justify-content: space-between;, font-size: 5vw;, width: 100%; height: auto;, etc.).  
The exact values or units required to achieve the intended responsive design.  
You must replace the placeholder content: ''; inside these declaration blocks with valid CSS declarations according to the instructions.  

Rules : 
Do not modify anything outside the specified declaration blocks.  
Do not remove or rename selectors — they must remain exactly as provided.  
Use the exact property values and units described in the instructions. Any mismatch will cause automated tests to fail.  
Do not remove the comments — they indicate where and how to edit.  
Maintain proper CSS syntax (property: value;).  

Submission Format :
A single CSS file: css/styles.css  
This file should contain all required changes within the given declaration blocks.  
No extra files, comments, or code changes outside the allowed areas.
