# JavaScript Variables Lab


## Problem Statement


Complete a series of tasks that demonstrate your understanding of JavaScript variable declarations (var, let, const), variable reassignment, and basic operations. The exercise covers fundamental concepts of JavaScript variable handling and string manipulation.


## Tasks Overview


### Task 1: Variable Declarations

- Declare a city variable using `var` and set it to "Mumbai"

- Declare a temperature variable using `let` and set it to 30

- Declare a country variable using `const` and set it to "India"


### Task 2: Variable Reassignment

- Reassign the temperature value to 35

- Demonstrate that const variables cannot be reassigned


### Task 3: Math Operations

- Declare two variables num1 and num2 using let

- Set num1 to 8 and num2 to 4

- Perform and display addition and subtraction operations


### Task 4: String Concatenation

- Declare firstName as "John" and lastName as "Doe"

- Create a fullName by concatenating the two variables


### Task 5: Variable Reassignment Practice

- Declare favoriteColor as "blue"

- Reassign it to "green"


### Task 6: Const Variables

- Demonstrate understanding of const variable immutability


### Task 7: String Manipulation

- Convert a given string to camel case

- Original string: "First name of the user"


## Expected Output Format


Your program should generate output in this format:

```

City: Mumbai

Temperature: 30

Country: India

Updated Temperature: 35

Addition: 12

Subtraction: 4

Full Name: John Doe

Original Favorite Color: blue

Updated Favorite Color: green

Camel Case: firstNameOfTheUser

```


## Understanding Variable Types


- `var`: Function-scoped or globally-scoped variable (generally discouraged in modern JavaScript)

- `let`: Block-scoped variable that can be reassigned

- `const`: Block-scoped variable that cannot be reassigned after initialization


Do not remove the existing HTML elements or change their IDs or edit the existing JavaScript code. You can add new JavaScript code as needed.
